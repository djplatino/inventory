# inventory
Currently, we, at https://www.poncesolutions.com, are working a Retail Inventory app that will put inventory equipment accessible to the public with a very low budget. The app eventually will be available in IOS and Android.
To complement the app, we are putting together a way to process the inventory.
This project will allow you to take specific formatted files and combine multiple files into a single repository from which you can use existing report and export options. You will be free to add your own report and export options.

We will be building a local server using open source projects.
Below are the different pieces of software that will be needed.

When finished, this project will be able to be installed on many operating systems.

Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/ - Used to create your own server on your computer.
MySQL - https://www.mysql.com/ - Used to store your data.
