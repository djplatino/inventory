# inventory
Currently, we at https://www.poncesolutions.com, are working a Retail Inventory app that will put inventory equipment accessable to the public with a very low budget. The app eventually will be available in IOS and Android.
To complement the app, we are putting together a way to process the inventory.
This project will allow you to take specific formatted files and combine multiple files into a single repository from which you can use existing report and export options. You will be free to add your own report and export options.
