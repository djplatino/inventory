# inventory
Currently, we, at https://www.poncesolutions.com, are working a Retail Inventory app that will put inventory equipment accessible to the public with a very low budget. The app eventually will be available in IOS and Android.
To complement the app, we are putting together a way to process the inventory.
This project will allow you to take specific formatted files and combine multiple files into a single repository from which you can use existing report and export options. You will be free to add your own report and export options.

We will be building a local server using open source projects.
Below are the different pieces of software that will be needed.

When finished, this project will be able to be installed on many operating systems.

Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/ - Used to create your own server on your computer.
MySQL - https://www.mysql.com/ - Used to store your data.<br>

JQUERY - https://jquery.com/ - JavaScript library used on your index.html.<br>
D3.js - https://d3js.org/ - JavaScript library used on your index.html<br>
DC.js - https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/ - JavaScript library used on your index.html<br>
Crossfilter.js - http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/ - JavaScript library used on your index.html<br>
Font Awesome - https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/ - JavaScript library used on your index.html<br>

The reason for listing all the software instead of providing a directory with all of them is to ensure you that get the most current versions.

In the future, we may make available a complete directory, but for now you can install the software that is needed.
